" We know that the Personal Training Department is the heart and soul of a club - especially at South Pacific Health Clubs. We want our Trainers to match our equipment - edgy, performance driven, with skills and expertise that are the latest and the best. Working hard within the industry for 2 decades, our proven record was achieved by winning Victorian Fitness Business of the Year - three times running. We are and continue to be an intricate part of the Industry since our inception, and are a business that promotes a positive and nurturing environment, not only for our staff, but also our members. With an innate passion about the Industry and the Community, we are always striving to improve our standards and be the best that we can be. This is not just an ordinary department, in not just any ordinary gym! And recently there have been more fantastic renovations and additions in equipment and facilities across our Clubs. So you've done all the training and have all the qualifications - well, that's the easy part. Actually knowing and understanding that it takes a lot more to become a Personal Trainer, that's another issue. So do you really know how to make a real difference to someone's life? Know how to motivate, to listen, to cajole - when to be serious and strong - then when to give a bit of slack? Are you one of those rare Personal Trainers? So in keeping with our vision, we need a Personal Trainer to become part of our talented team in a part time role of 19 hours per week. This role does not involve rent, you will be paid a salary to personal train, teach classes and provide a service to our members that is second to none We have members that are desperate for Trainers to help them on a one-to-one basis, to achieve their goals!! You will be part of the driving force that is our team of trainers. You will be training as hard, and smart, as we will be helping you by updating your training methods and practices within the team. Of course you will need to have relevant qualifications - Cert 3 & 4 or relevant Tertiary Diploma or Degree. Good Industry experience. A personality that sees the positive in any situation, laughs, is a 'doer', can easily motivate and help their clients achieve their goals. And of course loves what they do. Interested?
